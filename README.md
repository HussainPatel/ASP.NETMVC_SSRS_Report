# ASP.NETMVC_SSRS_Report
Sample project on displaying SSRS Report in ASP.NET MVC
This project contains code for displaying an SSRS report in ASP.NET MVC application. 
For this demo I am using 
Visual Studio 2012, ( can used with VS 2013 , VS 2015) 
ASP.NET MVC 4 - Empty Template, 
an existing SSRS report deployed on SSRS Server and 
a nuGet package. 

I will be using a nuGet package called ReportViewer for MVC.Â
